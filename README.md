This project was brought to light by using the cocktaildb API . 


The input field was created with the use of the "keyup" eventlistener so that as you type out the particular cocktail name you are looking for it will go ahead to display some cocktails related to the names you've typed 
so far until you enter the exact name of the cocktail you looking for. 

When you enter a cocktail name that is not in the API data an error message will be returned.


I paginated the project so that the UI will look more organized, you can click either the next,prev or the numbers buttons to display rest of the cocktails in it's specific pages.

I also added the A - Z buttons as an alternative way to find your cocktail, so that when you click any of the A-Z buttons it will display the cocktails that starts with the name of the particular letter you clicked 
for example if you want to look up for the cocktail that starts with the letter "V", when you click on the letter "V" it will display all the cocktails that starts with the letter 'V' 
and you can go ahead and use the pagination buttons to display the rest of the cocktails with the letter 'V'.
